1. Probably use tf idf

2. Other libraries:
- Light GBM (put all y values)
- catboost

3. Add another approach (another vectorizer, maybe tf idf)
- We need a model that we can fine tune parameters.


- BPE encoding
- Fast text
- Glove (averaged, becasue it encodes words)
Try different encodings

4.
Scientific mode
run separate cells like that

#%%
a = 2
print(a)
#%%


5.
Threshold

Meeting with amir 2:

regression model based on pretrained embeddings

Encode text:
tf idf
bm25
----------------

tf idf - basic word encoding - 1 x 10000 vectors (for each word), then reduce the dimension
and show the clusters

Tasks for today
1.
2. Apply tf idf with PCA (dimensionality reduction) and see accuracy
3. Architecture of project

Also change format ()
Also use binary format maybe
